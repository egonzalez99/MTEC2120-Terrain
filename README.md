**Unity 3D Game Showcase**

Welcome to our Unity 3D game showcase! Our project features various mechanics and gameplay experiences designed to engage players in immersive gameplay.

**Overview:**

This game, developed in Unity, presents different mechanics that are continuously being explored and refined. Our current demo includes two main branches:

**Time Manipulation Branch:**

In this branch, players can manipulate time by reversing the falling bricks. By differentiating between the initial position and the current position, players can reverse the trajectory of falling objects, providing a unique gameplay experience.

**Shooting Gallery Branch:**

The main focus of this branch is a shooting gallery experience. Players can engage in target practice with a standard shooting mode where bullets travel straight or switch to an alternative fire mode where bullets bounce off surfaces for added challenge and excitement. However, the bullets trajectory isn't shooting straight ahead where to gun is pointed. 

**Additional Features:**

- **Light Mechanics:** Experience dynamic lighting effects with the ability to switch between day and night modes. Utilize a flashlight mechanic to navigate dark environment.

**How to Play:**
- Use the appropriate controls to interact with the game environment.
- In the Time Manipulation branch, manipulate time to reverse the falling bricks.
- In the Shooting Gallery branch, aim and shoot targets using the provided controls.
- Experiment with different gameplay mechanics and enjoy the immersive experience.

These are the controls for my reverse time demo that might be changed over time. But these are the controls needed for the project.
